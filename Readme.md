Extreme Pro-gaming is an educational board game that I designed for my master's thesis. 2-3 players simulate an agile process in which they have to balance the consequences of technical debt with the need to implement features. In addition, events show that the work of software developers is affected by environmental influences.

**This repository contains the various game elements**: The game instructions (*Anleitung*), the cards (*Karten*), an overview card (*Iteration Overview*), and the game board (*Spielfeld*). Since we designed this game for a German-language study program, the cards are also written in German.

To generate and customize the game elements, please refer to the readmes in the subdirectories.

**To play the game you will also need** markers for Storypoints and Technical Debt. We used hard plastic gummy bears for story points and reversible chips with a blue and a red side for the technical debt.
