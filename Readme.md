Extreme Pro-gaming is an educational board game that I designed for my master's thesis. 2-3 players simulate an agile process in which they have to balance the consequences of technical debt with the need to implement features. In addition, events show that the work of software developers is affected by environmental influences.

**This repository contains the various game elements**: 
- The game instructions (*Anleitung*), 
- The cards (*Karten*), 
- An overview card (*Iteration Overview*), 
- The game board (*Spielfeld*). 

Originally, this game was designed for a german-language study program, but we also translated everything into English. In each game element folder you will find subfolders for each language that we currently have available. Please refer to the game element folders' readmes in case you want to adapt this game for your needs.

**To play the game you will also need** markers for Storypoints and Technical Debt. We used hard plastic gummy bears for story points and reversible chips with a blue and a red side for the technical debt.
